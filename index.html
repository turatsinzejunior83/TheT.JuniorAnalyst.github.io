									<p>Data Analyst Portfolio Project : Movie Correlation Project with Python

										🗾 the primary objective of this project was to identify the corporation that exhibits the strongest correlation when comparing various factors. Specifically, our focus was on examining the relationship between movie budget and gross earnings.
										
										➗ Through extensive analysis, including the generation of multiple correlation plots, we were able to uncover insightful findings. Notably, I observed that factors such as runtime and votes displayed the highest correlation coefficient of 0.515308. This indicates a significant positive relationship between these variables, suggesting that movies with longer runtimes and higher vote counts tend to have a stronger impact on overall gross earnings.
										
										➖ By delving into these correlations, we gain valuable insights into the key factors influencing the financial success of movies. Such knowledge can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding budget allocation and strategic planning, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the corporation.
										
										Therefore In this project various things has been done such
										
										🔘 1)Importing certain libraries
										🔘 2)Dealing with Columns has Missing Data
										🔘 3)Check Data types for Each column
										🔘 4)Change Column Datatype
										💠 5)Creating Correct_year Column match with Released Date
										💠 6)Sorting Gross Column by ascending
										💠 7)Displaying all Column at Once
										💠 8)Drop Duplicates column
										💠 9)Scotter plot between Gross and Budget
										💡 10)Plot Budget VS Gross using Seaborn
										💡 11)Correlation
										💡 12)Converting all Columns in Numerical</p>

									<p>
										Here's a step-by-step outline project process for how I scraped product data from Amazon using Python:

										1. Install Required Libraries:
  										- Install the necessary libraries: `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `webdriver_manager`.

										2. Set Up WebDriver:
  										- Import the required modules: `webdriver` from Selenium and `webdriver_manager` for managing the WebDriver.
 										- Set up the WebDriver using `webdriver.Chrome()` or the appropriate driver for your browser.
  										- Optionally, configure the WebDriver options (e.g., headless mode, proxy settings).

										3. Navigate to the Product Page:
 										- Use the WebDriver's `get()` method to navigate to the product page URL on Amazon.

										4. Extract the Page Source:
  										- Retrieve the page source using `driver.page_source` and store it in a variable.

										5. Close the WebDriver:
 										- Close the WebDriver using `driver.quit()` to free system resources.

										6. Parse the HTML:
										- Import `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library.
										- Create a `BeautifulSoup` object by passing the page source and the parser (e.g., "html.parser") to it.

										7. Find and Extract Product Information:
										- Inspect the HTML structure of the product page to identify the relevant elements.
										- Use BeautifulSoup's methods to find and extract the desired information (e.g., product title, price) from the parsed HTML.

										8. Process and Store the Data:
										- Process the extracted data as needed (e.g., remove unwanted characters, convert to appropriate data types).
										- Store the data in a suitable data structure (e.g., variables, lists, dictionaries) for further processing or analysis.

										9. Save the Data:
										- Use the `csv` module or other appropriate methods to save the extracted data to a file (e.g., CSV, Excel, database).</p>

										Here is your task Scrape data from the web The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax.

										The team leader wants you to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your analysis. To get started with the data collection, 
										you can use the “Jupyter Notebook” in the Resources section below to run some Python code that will help to collect some data.

										Analyse data Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. The data will be very messy and contain purely text. You will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. 
										When the data is clean, you should perform your own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, you could look at topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into
										the content of the reviews. It is recommended to complete this task using Python, however, you can use any tool that you wish. You can use some of the documentation websites provided in the Resources section 
										below to analyse the data.Please ensure that you have created a folder called "data" and mapped your file path.

										Present insights Your manager would like you to summarise your findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting. You should create visualisations and metrics 
										to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from your analysis. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided to complete the slide.

										                                          ********Task 2: Predicting customer buying behaviour*******
										Here is your task Explore and prepare the dataset First, spend some time exploring the dataset in the “Getting Started” Jupyter Notebook provided in the Resources section below to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then, you should consider how to prepare the dataset for a predictive model. You should think about any new features you want to create in order to make your model even better. You can make use of the Resources provided to get you started with this task.

										Train a machine learning model When your data is ready for modelling, you should train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, you should use an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. For example, a RandomForest is very good for this purpose.

										Evaluate model and present findings After training your model, you should evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, you should create a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, you should summarise your findings in a single slide to be sent to your manager. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided in the Resources section below to create your summary and make use of the links provided to help with this task.

										It is recommended that the analysis portion of this task is done in Python.
										
										                                                  ********What I did  ********
										
										1-Step:I collected rich of data as I can by web scrapping from SKYtrax(https://www.airlinequality.com/) in order to improve the output of my analysis
										2-Step:I cleaned data to prepare the data for analysis and  Analyse It
										3-Step:I performed my own analysis to uncover some insights by modelling, sentiment analysis to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.

										PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization 
										of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. 
										They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. 
										Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.
                                                                                Moreover, for those customers that are at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them to stay with our client. 
										The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).
										These are the following Tasks supposed I worked on as Data Scientist:   
										1.Task 1: Business Understanding and hypethesis Framing
										2.Task 2: Explarotory Data Analysis
										3.Task 3: Feature Engineering and Modelling
										4.Task 4: Findings and Recommendations

										Responsible AI is top of mind for business leaders, along with an urgent need to understand the decision process behind these algorithms. With great potential comes great risk. Not being able to understand an AI system can lead to a “black box” effect, which limits an organisation’s ability to explain and defend business-critical decisions. 

										PwC’s Responsible AI approach can help. We provide services to help explain both overall decision-making and also individual choices and predictions, tailored to the perspectives of different stakeholders.

										Jakob, is your team manager, is keen to meet you. Ready to hit the road? Our first stop is Geneva. Here’s an overview of the project and what I need you to do.

										A large bank has asked us to evaluate the marketing algorithms they use for retail banking. Their sophisticated phone marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Based on that assessment, the bank then optimises its phone calling strategy. With this algorithm, the bank has been successful in predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits. 

										Management is now interested in finding out how a classification model can lead to certain decision-making processes. 
										
										These are the following Tasks supposed I worked on as Digital Intelligence Expert:   
										Task 1: Create a classification model in Python. Feel free to use libraries such as SkLearn, Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch. 
										Task 2: Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
										Task 3: Develop some form of plot or graph with brief comments on your observations. 
										Task 4: Heads up! Jakob left you a voice message to help you with this task.
