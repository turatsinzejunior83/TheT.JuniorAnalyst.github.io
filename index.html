									<p>Data Analyst Portfolio Project : Movie Correlation Project with Python

										🗾 the primary objective of this project was to identify the corporation that exhibits the strongest correlation when comparing various factors. Specifically, our focus was on examining the relationship between movie budget and gross earnings.
										
										➗ Through extensive analysis, including the generation of multiple correlation plots, we were able to uncover insightful findings. Notably, I observed that factors such as runtime and votes displayed the highest correlation coefficient of 0.515308. This indicates a significant positive relationship between these variables, suggesting that movies with longer runtimes and higher vote counts tend to have a stronger impact on overall gross earnings.
										
										➖ By delving into these correlations, we gain valuable insights into the key factors influencing the financial success of movies. Such knowledge can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding budget allocation and strategic planning, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the corporation.
										
										Therefore In this project various things has been done such
										
										🔘 1)Importing certain libraries
										🔘 2)Dealing with Columns has Missing Data
										🔘 3)Check Data types for Each column
										🔘 4)Change Column Datatype
										💠 5)Creating Correct_year Column match with Released Date
										💠 6)Sorting Gross Column by ascending
										💠 7)Displaying all Column at Once
										💠 8)Drop Duplicates column
										💠 9)Scotter plot between Gross and Budget
										💡 10)Plot Budget VS Gross using Seaborn
										💡 11)Correlation
										💡 12)Converting all Columns in Numerical</p>

									<p>
										Here's a step-by-step outline project process for how I scraped product data from Amazon using Python:

										1. Install Required Libraries:
  										- Install the necessary libraries: `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `webdriver_manager`.

										2. Set Up WebDriver:
  										- Import the required modules: `webdriver` from Selenium and `webdriver_manager` for managing the WebDriver.
 										- Set up the WebDriver using `webdriver.Chrome()` or the appropriate driver for your browser.
  										- Optionally, configure the WebDriver options (e.g., headless mode, proxy settings).

										3. Navigate to the Product Page:
 										- Use the WebDriver's `get()` method to navigate to the product page URL on Amazon.

										4. Extract the Page Source:
  										- Retrieve the page source using `driver.page_source` and store it in a variable.

										5. Close the WebDriver:
 										- Close the WebDriver using `driver.quit()` to free system resources.

										6. Parse the HTML:
										- Import `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library.
										- Create a `BeautifulSoup` object by passing the page source and the parser (e.g., "html.parser") to it.

										7. Find and Extract Product Information:
										- Inspect the HTML structure of the product page to identify the relevant elements.
										- Use BeautifulSoup's methods to find and extract the desired information (e.g., product title, price) from the parsed HTML.

										8. Process and Store the Data:
										- Process the extracted data as needed (e.g., remove unwanted characters, convert to appropriate data types).
										- Store the data in a suitable data structure (e.g., variables, lists, dictionaries) for further processing or analysis.

										9. Save the Data:
										- Use the `csv` module or other appropriate methods to save the extracted data to a file (e.g., CSV, Excel, database).</p>
